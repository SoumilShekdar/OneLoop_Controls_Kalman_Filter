# Accelarometer Intergration
# Objective: Position detection with velocity derived through accelaration
# Key Components: 1) Model accelaration as measured by the Accelarometer
#                 2) Integrate Accelaration to determine velocity
# Assumptions: - Sample Measured position with 0.01km/hr^2 standard deviation
